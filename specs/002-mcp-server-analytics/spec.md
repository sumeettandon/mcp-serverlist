# Feature Specification: MCP Server Analytics Dashboard

**Feature Branch**: `002-mcp-server-analytics`  
**Created**: 2025-09-18  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Building a one-page webapp that lists MCP server analytics. Using existing MCP registry API to aggregate data regularly and present it to users in one richly-formatted page with graphs. Dark themed, Apple-like design with modern color scheme. Includes server filtering (local/remote) reflected in charts. Time-series charts show counts over time with adjustable granularity (hourly to yearly). Also includes an about page."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer interested in MCP server statistics, I want to view analytics about MCP server deployments over time, so I can understand adoption trends and make informed decisions about my own MCP server deployment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the analytics page has loaded, **When** I view the default view, **Then** I see time-series charts showing MCP server counts with hourly granularity
2. **Given** I'm viewing the analytics charts, **When** I switch the granularity to daily/weekly/monthly/yearly, **Then** the charts update to show data at the selected granularity
3. **Given** I'm viewing server statistics, **When** I filter by local/remote servers, **Then** all charts update to reflect only the selected server types
4. **Given** I want to learn more about the analytics, **When** I navigate to the about page, **Then** I see information explaining the data collection and presentation methodology

### Edge Cases
- What happens when data for certain time periods is missing?
- How does the system handle timezone differences in data collection?
- What's displayed when no servers of a filtered type exist?
- How are server count spikes/anomalies handled in the visualization?
- What happens during data aggregation window (when new data is being processed)?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display time-series charts showing MCP server counts over time
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow switching between hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly data granularity
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide filtering between local and remote server types
- **FR-004**: System MUST update all visualizations when filters or granularity changes
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain a dark theme with Apple-like design aesthetics
- **FR-006**: System MUST aggregate data from the MCP registry API at regular intervals
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide an about page explaining the analytics methodology
- **FR-008**: Charts MUST display dates on the x-axis and counts on the y-axis
- **FR-009**: System MUST support responsive layout for various screen sizes [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: minimum supported screen size?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST show loading states while data is being processed
- **FR-011**: System MUST cache processed data to optimize performance
- **FR-012**: System MUST clearly indicate the last data update timestamp

### Key Entities
- **TimeSeriesDataPoint**: Represents a single point in time with associated server counts
  - Timestamp
  - Total server count
  - Local server count
  - Remote server count
  
- **VisualizationConfig**: Represents user's current view preferences
  - Selected granularity (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly/yearly)
  - Active filters (local/remote/all)
  - Selected date range [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should users be able to zoom/pan to specific time periods?]

- **DataAggregation**: Represents a processed data collection
  - Collection timestamp
  - Time period covered
  - Data points
  - Processing status

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Page MUST load and become interactive within 3 seconds on desktop devices [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: performance targets for mobile?]
- **NFR-002**: Chart interactions MUST feel smooth with no visible lag
- **NFR-003**: Data aggregation MUST complete within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum processing time?]
- **NFR-004**: UI MUST be accessible with proper contrast ratios for dark theme
- **NFR-005**: System MUST support common screen readers and keyboard navigation
